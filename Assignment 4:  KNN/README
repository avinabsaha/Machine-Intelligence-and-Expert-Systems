To run the code, use python 15EC10071.py

Dependencies: numpy and sklearn
Datset: iris.csv

Details:
For Naive Implementation:
First we store all the training examples as KNN is an example of instance based learning.
Then for the test case, 
We find distances of each the test example from each of the training example.
Now, depending on value of K we take those many closest neighbours and take the majority vote on their classification label.

For Sklearn implementation:
Use KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k) for defining the model, and fit and predict to train and test the model.
