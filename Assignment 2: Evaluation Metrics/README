Instructions to Run the code: python 15EC10071.py
Requirements: matplotlib,numpy,scipy

FPF and FNF are directly found from the Normal Distributions provided.
They are stored in an array.
TPF is obtained as 1-FNF

Now, FPF and TPF are plotted. The code will produce the results as .png files in the working directory (for both companies)

The Area under the plots are found using Trapezium Approximation of Area under curve.

The both areas are compared and the one with the higher area is displayed as the preferred device as higher area corresponds to higher accuracy
